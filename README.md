A Zodiac modifier that executes from avatar, and enforces revert on internal transaction failure

### Solidity Compiler

The contracts have been developed with [Solidity 0.8.6](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases/tag/v0.8.6). This version of Solidity made all arithmetic checked by default, therefore eliminating the need for explicit overflow or underflow (or other arithmetic) checks. This version of solidity was chosen as it allows to easily cast bytes to bytes4 and bytes32.
